This is the version 2.0 of Sir Pumkinstein's Asphodel Meadows. This has been uploaded with permission of [@AidenGyory](https://github.com/AidenGyory)

This version of the pack is compatible with Minecraft version 1.16. Any newer version of Minecraft breaks the world generation for the custom dimension. 

If you wish to use the pack with either a newer game version, or for Spigot-based servers, use the "v1" branch as it uses the old method of generating the meadows on top of the Nether roof. The v1 branch is known to be compitble up to v1.18, and is functional in 1.19 with some glitches.
