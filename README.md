This is the version 1 of Sir Pumkinstein's Asphodel Meadows with modifications originally aimed at Spigot servers by Greaper88. This has been uploaded with permission of [@AidenGyory](https://github.com/AidenGyory)

This version of the pack is compatible with Minecraft version 1.18, and is functional in 1.19. The downside to this version is the use of the Nether roof instead of using a custom dimension as introduced in MC v1.16.
